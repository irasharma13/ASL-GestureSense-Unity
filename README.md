## ASL GestureSense Unity

ASL GestureSense Unity is a project aimed at bringing American Sign Language (ASL) to life in virtual environments. It enables developers to create applications that recognize ASL gestures in real-time, fostering natural and inclusive interactions for the deaf and hard of hearing community.

## How to Run the App

To run the ASL GestureSense Unity application, you'll need the following:

1. **Unity**: Ensure you have Unity installed on your development machine. You can download it from [Unity's official website](https://unity.com/).

2. **Meta Quest 2**: You'll need a Meta Quest 2 device to experience the application in virtual reality. The Meta Quest 2 provides the hardware necessary for immersive interactions.
